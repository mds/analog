    The form of our letters, the older handwriting and inscriptions as much as
    the cuttings in use today, reflects a convention that has slowly solidified,
    an agreement hardened in many battles. Even after the Renaissance several
    European countries retained broken, blackletter national scripts in opposition to roman, the obligatory type for all Latin material; yet even today, I hope, the last word about Fraktur has not been spoken.

    Apart from that, the roman minuscule has been our way of writing for hundreds
    of years. What followed were merely fashionable variations, here and there even
    deformations, of the noble basic form, but no improvement whatever. The
    punches of Claude Garamond, cut around 1530 in Paris, are simply unsurpassed in
    their clarity, readability and beauty. Garamond appeared on the scene at a
    time when the occidental book, as an object, cast off its medieval
    ponderousness and took up the form which today is still the best: the slender
    and upright rectangular body, comprising folded sheets stitched or sewn at
    the back, in a cover whose protruding edges protect the trimmed pages.
